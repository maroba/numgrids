# numgrids

Spectral methods for numerical grids in any number of dimensions supporting both non-periodic and periodic boundaries.

## Usage / Example Notebooks

To get an idea how *numgrids* can be used, have a look at the following example notebooks:

- [How to define grids]()
- [Polar coordinates on unit disk](examples/polar-cooordinates-on-unit-disk.ipynb)
- [Spherical coordinates and their Laplacian]()
- [Solving the Schrödinger equation for the quantum harmonic oscillator (1D and 3D)]()
- [Solving the Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen atom]()

## Installation

```shell
pip install numgrids
```
